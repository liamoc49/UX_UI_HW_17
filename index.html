            <p>Hi, my name is Liam O’Connell. I am a UX designer who is always looking for new and exciting ways to present information to people. Whether that is through drastic redesigns of websites to helping to create a new brand identity for an organization I feel passionate about. </p>

                <p>While my education background is in Media Communications graduating Summa Cum Laude from Saint Xavier University in 2021, one of my biggest passions in life has been graphic design. As long as I can remember I have always found myself doodling on the margins of notebooks with a large majority of those doodles being different designs or patterns. It wasn’t until my second semester of my senior year of college that I realized that there was something I could actually do to use those skills that was until I took a graphic design class and it opened my eyes to a field that up to that point I had not even thought of.  I always found the importance of good layout that speaks to the wants of the developer and the needs of the user. In Early Spring of 2022 I took a UX/UI Bootcamp through Northwestern University where I learned about the basics of User Experience as well as User Interaction along with a light amount of coding. </p>
